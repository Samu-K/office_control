Home office control project

This is meant to be a program to control my home office using object detection and facial recognition

The main utility of the program is that it will detect if a person is in the room, 
and then put the computer to sleep and turn off the Philips Hue smart lamp if they exit the room

You can also pause the program by holding up a stop sign. This way the program will not sleep the computer even if you exit.
You can unpause the program in a similar way.

The program can also be fully closed by holding up a fist.
